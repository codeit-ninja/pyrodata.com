			<p>U.S. Patent #4,497,676, February 5, 1985.
</p><p>Laboratory Process
</p><p>A typical laboratory recipe is as follows: Weigh
105.7 g of potassium nitrate, 65.2 g of ascorbic acid, 3.7 g of
potassium bicarbonate, and 128.5 g of deionized water into a 250
ml Erylemenmer flask. (2) Potassium bicarbonate is added as a
precaution to prevent the formation of nitric acid due to acidic
impurities present in the raw materials. Agitate the slurry using a
magnetic stirring bar. The temperature falls several degrees during
the solid dissolution process. Heat the solution to 600C to
completely dissolve the solids. When the solids are dissolved, the
solution will be pale yellow.
</p><p>Pour the solution into a 45 cm x 37L cm pyrex
dish. Some material will  crystallize out in the coo- dish but will re-
dissolve Later. The solution will form a Layer 2-3 m-thick. Place the
dish into an oven preheated to 7-200C. During the first 1 1/2 hr. of
heat treatment, the majority of the water is removed. The dried
solid will rise to a thickness of 5-10 mm and turn from yellow to
brown in color. The best performing material is heated for 3 hr. The
tray is removed from the oven, covered with aluminum foil and
allowed to cool to room temperature.
</p><p>The heat-treated material is a brittle sponge like solid which breaks
up easily when touched. As soon as cool, the solid is removed from
the tray and ground into a powder using a mortar and pestle. At
this point, we have Golden Powder in its crude state. The powder
is hygroscopic and care should be taken to minimize exposure to
water or humid atmosphere to avoid caking.
</p><p>2. Potassium nitrate and potassium bicarbonate are reagent,--
grade material. The ascorbic acid is Hoffmann-La Roche, U.S.P.
grade material.
</p><p>-Heat Treatment
</p><p>While the water is vaporized, crystals of
potassium nitrate 10-50 microns in size are formed. These
crystals are visible in the final product under a scanning electron
microscope (Figure 1). The photograph shows the cross-section
of a typical particle. The lighter particles seem to be crystals of
potassium nitrate surrounded by a matrix of ascorbic acid
"polymer". Golden powder is similar to other composite
propellants where the oxidizer is coated by the fuel. In this case,
the oxidizer is potassium nitrate and the fuel is ascorbic acid
polymer.
</p><p>Figure 1
Scanning Electron Micrograph of Golden Powder (20OX)
</p><p>Although we do not know the reactions which take
place during the heat treatment, several observations have been
made. The potassium nitrate is essentially unaffected by the
heating so the reacting component is ascorbic acid. During the
treatment, gaseous products are given off which causes the
powder to rise. These products have been identified as carbon
dioxide and water and account for a weight loss of 10-12% during
the heating (Figure 2). This loss is in addition to the water used to
dissolve the ascorbic acid and potassium nitrate. The reaction
progress can be followed by monitoring the ascorbic acid content
of the powder.
</p><p>Several temperatures have been used for the heat treatment
ranging from 105oC to 140oC (Figure 3). As we would expect, the
degradation is more rapid at higher temperatures.For convenience
on a laboratory scale, we chose 120oC asour working temperature.
The best powder contains 2-5% residua ascorbic acid which is
produced after about 3 hr at 1200C. Higher temperatures are
possible with good control on the heating time and temperature.
Overheating of the powder results in the formation of carbon and a
decrease in performance and safety.
</p><p>The physical properties of golden powder are summarized below in
Table I. Golden Powder has several advantageous properties as a
propellant. It can be molded without any binders into a solid fuel for
use as consumable cartridges. The heat of combustion is 5%
higher and the gas volume produced is 10% greater than an
equivalent amount of black powder. The residue on ignition is only
28% compared to about 50% using black powder. In addition, the
residue from burning golden powder is water soluble, unlike many
other propellants.

Ignition Temperature  333o C  313oC (4)
</p><p>4.Initiation temperature from differential calorimentry on
Gearhart-Owen Industries Superfine, FFFG Black Powder.
</p><p>Using differential scanning calorimetry, the ignition temperature of
golden powder was determined to be 333oC (Figure 4). The
ignition temperature is 200C higher than that measured for black
powder in the same equipment. Scanning calorimetric studies show
a two-stage exotherm over a temperature range of 333oC to
455oC.
</p><p>Ballistic Performance
</p><p>Although Golden Powder offers a wide spectrum
of applications, one area which has attracted the attention of end
users is its use as a black powder substitute. Golden Powder can
be easily granulated to any grade of gun powder. The crude
powder can be compacted to pellets or sheets which can be milled
to appropriate grain sizes. We have made granulation's of golden
powder which pass through a 20-mesh screen but are retained on
a 40-mesh screen. This material was tested ballistically in a .45
caliber, 32 inch rifled test barrel. Muzzle velocities where
measured using lumiIine screens and the peak pressures
measured using lead crushers. The balIistic data from three
separate lots or golden powder are summarized in Table 2.

SD               20.2  230
(3 Lots)
</p><p>These muzzle velocities are comparable to black powder at significantly
lower chamber pressures. The ballistic results are extremely
reproducible from shot to shot and from lot to lot. The
standard deviation of velocities over the fifteen shots was
only 20.2 ft./sec. and the standard deviation of peak pressures was
230 LUP.
</p><p>As we stated earlier, the best performing material
was powder in which the ascorbic acid has been reacted to a
residual level of 2-5%. The ballistic performance of golden powder
has been measured as a function of the ascorbic assay (Figure 5).
The muzzle velocity of the powder, which has a residual ascorbic
acid assay -less than 5%, is double that of powder which has an
ascorbic acid assay greater than 30%.
</p><p>Safety
</p><p>One of the advantageous properties of golden
powder is its safety. Unlike black powder, golden powder can be
shipped as a flammable so-'Lid following the recommendation of
the Bureau of Mines. They recommend a DOT classification as a
Class B Explosive. The Bureau of Mines testing included thermal
stability at 75oC for 48 hours during which golden powder was
stable. No detonation of golden powder occurred during the
blasting cap sensitivity test, the package burn test, and the squib
test. Golden powder did not ignite on the Association of American
Railroads Bureau of Explosives strip friction test in 10 out of 7-0
trials under 500 psig, which is equivalent to 100 pounds of friction
force.
</p><p>Summary
</p><p>Golden Powder is a new explosive product based
on ascorbic acid. Its combustion characteristics are comparable to
black powder but with several other distinct advantages. Golden
powder is safer to handle and transport. It forms about half the
residue as black powder when burned. The residue formed is
non-corrosive and is water-soluble. Golden powder is easily
molded into solid fuel elements which burn at a well controlled rate.
When used as gunpowder, the performance is comparable to black
powder but is significantly more reproducible. The inherent safety
of' the powder allows its shipment as a flammable solid by common
carrier. With these characteristics, golden powder is a product with
many potential applications.
